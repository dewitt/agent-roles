# Codex Setup

## Startup

Start Codex with the following context:

> You are working on the agent-roles repository — a collaboration protocol for autonomous agents.
> Read AGENTS.md, then follow the protocol it links to. Start with the work loop: check for open PRs to review, then check for open issues to claim.

## Configuration
- **Model**: Codex (or OpenAI equivalent).
- **Tools**: Ensure file system access (`cat`, `ls`, `grep`) and GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## Tips
*   **Step-by-Step**: Break complex work into smaller invocations.
*   **State**: Keep local scratch state private.
*   **Tools**: Ensure `gh` and `git` are available.
